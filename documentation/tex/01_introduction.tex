\section{Introduction}
For a realistic rendering with global illumination both the eye point of the viewer as well as the light sources are of importance. If only the view point is used as the origin for rays, caustics will be rendered poorly since their light path is rather obscure and improbable to be sampled. If only the light sources are used as origin points, there will be problems with indirect sources since the light rays are unlikely to reach the view point. The solution for both problems would be an increased number of samples. However, this increases the rendering time drastically. Bidirectional path tracing combines both approaches to get acceptable results in reasonable time \cite{lafortune1993bi}.
